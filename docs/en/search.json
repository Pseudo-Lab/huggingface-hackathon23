    "text": "03_Contributions and Submissions\nThis phase marks a critical juncture where you can enhance the value of your project through community interaction and assessment processes. The hackathon represents a valuable opportunity to share and grow each other’s work, so your active participation is highly encouraged!\n\nContributing to a Project\nBegin by visiting the Community tab of a project that piques your interest and click the New Pull Request button.\n\nTo clearly communicate your intended contributions, please concisely articulate an overview of your planned work in the commit message section of the new window that appears. This approach significantly eases the process of tracking project contribution histories later on.\n\nAs shown on the screen, proceed with clone, fetch, and checkout to set up your local environment for work.\n\n\n\nAccess Token Generation and Login Process\nSubsequently, you’ll need to create an access token through your Hugging Face account and utilize it for login. This token plays a crucial role in authenticating and safeguarding your contributions. For detailed instructions, please refer to the English guide.\n\nTo verify a successful login, execute the huggingface-cli whoami command in your terminal.\n\n\nSharing Work and Committing\nCommit important stages of your project as you progress, and push them to maintain continuous communication with the community. This process ensures the transparent sharing of your work’s ongoing progress.\n\n\n\nCrafting a README\nThe project’s README file should be meticulously crafted to ensure that anyone can easily comprehend the project. It should provide ample information about the project, including its objectives, the technologies employed, key changes, among other pertinent details.\n\n\nHackathon and Evaluation Timeline\nFollowing the submission of your project, there is a three-week period throughout the entire hackathon during which your project will be subject to community reviews and evaluations. During this phase, to uphold the caliber of the project and prevent any unfair practices, remember that each team must receive at least (number of team members + 2) ‘likes’ to be issued a completion certificate."

In this hackathon, you will have the opportunity to register your innovative ideas and projects in the Hugging Face KREW Hackathon 2023 collection, and share them with both the local and global audience via a wall of fame in our offline event and community blog post on Hugging Face.\n\"Hugging Face KREW Hackathon 2023\" (collection)\n    ├── ParticipantProject(1) (space)\n    ├── ...\n    ├── ParticipantProject(n-1) (model)\n    └── ParticipantProject(n) (dataset)\n\nRegistering with Hugging Face\nBefore you begin, sign up with Hugging Face through this link: hf.co/join. Become part of a global community by completing a simple registration process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnrolling as a Pseudo Lab Contributor\nAfter signing up, proceed to the Contributor Registration page and gain access to ‘Pseudo Lab’ projects. This platform is where your ideas will shine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectly Creating Your Project\nTry creating a new Space by clicking the New button within the Pseudo Lab organization. For the Space name, use something representative of your project. In the license selection, we recommend the “Apache 2.0 License.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring your project for actual deployment is crucial. In the SDK options, we particularly recommend Gradio for beginners. It’s user-friendly, offering various examples for quick learning. While the basic free CPU resources are provided for hardware, you can request additional GPU resources if necessary. However, please make such requests only when essential, as all participants share these resources!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing advanced GPU hardware resources will consume the overall hackathon Credit.\nWe request efficient usage with consideration for other participants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSharing in the Collection\nFantastic! Now that you’ve created a space for launching your project, you’re probably eager to introduce it to other participants. Let’s see how to link your project to the hackathon collection.\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the ... button in the upper right corner and select Add to collection.\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose Hugging Face KREW Hackathon 2023 (pseudolab) to add your project to the hackathon collection.\n\n\nImporting an Existing Project\nIf you’ve already initiated a project in your personal space, no need to worry. You can clone the space, change the ownership to pseudolab, and add it to the collection following the same procedure."
