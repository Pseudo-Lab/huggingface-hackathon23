    "text": "Application\n\nInformation for applicants\nThe Everyday AI Hackathon is where participants will explore the intersection of AI, Hugging Face technology, and daily life through demonstration tutorials and hands-on “hacking” projects. To best benefit from the event, we recommend some familiarity or experience with:\n\nHugging Face technology and tools; and\nProgramming skills using Python. We plan to accept participants with diverse skill levels and backgrounds in programming. However, to best benefit from and contribute to the program, participants are expected to have some experience with Python programming.\n\nNo prior experience with Hugging Face technology is required, but we encourage both beginner and more experienced participants to apply.\n\n\nApplication Form\nIn the application form, we encourage you to think about and provide an AI use case that you would like to prototype. During the hackathon, participants will get into teams of their choosing, around a common use case to “hack” - by which we mean collaboratively experiment working in with Hugging Face technology. The use cases provided in the application form will also help the organizers best prepare materials tailored to those use cases.\nApplications are now open! Please apply here"

    "text": "What to expect\n\nDuring the Everyday AI Hackathon, the selected participants will have access to Cloud environments and will be guided on how to use the environment, import needed data recipes and resources, and will have the opportunity to explore and develop AI applications using example tutorials as building blocks.\nParticipants will be able to freely ask questions about the hackathon through a dedicated discord channel as well as engage with other participants.\nThe Everyday AI Hackathon is an open science event: all tutorials and examples are developed openly and will be publicly available during and following the hackathon. Participants will strengthen their practice of open science, using open source code and “hacking” their projects openly to enable further discovery and contributions by the broader open community following the hackathon.\nThroughout the hackathon, participants will learn about Hugging Face’s impact on AI workflows for model and dataset discovery, usage, and prototyping to enable faster, more efficient time to science.\n\nIn the two weeks leading up to the hackathon, participants are encouraged to review background resources that will faciliate a more effective hackathon experience. These resources will be shared here leading up to the Hackathon dates, and will be accessible to all data users, whether they attend the hackathon or not.\nThe following datasets are currently available from the Hugging Face Hub. Participants can choose to prototype a cloud-based science workflow using a combination of these datasets, as well as data from other sources (e.g. AI Hub). If your preferred dataset is not yet available in the Hugging Face Hub, consider using a current cloud-based dataset as proxy to explore prototyping.\nExample use cases to explore (note these are for inspiration only, you are not limited to these workflows):\n\nTODO\n\nThis event is motivated by the dawn of the era of AI. Hugging Face is in the process of collecting models and datasets to its Hub, driven by a rapid rate of transformers-based innovations in the industry. More will be available in the Hugging Face Hub in the coming years. The paradigm shift from on-premise (local) to cloud-based model distribution, and that from “build from scratch” to “use and iterate” present opportunities and challenges. Guiding users through this transition is of the utmost importance."

So you control if/when you pull in changes. a clone on the other hand, will be linked to the original repository- so if you do “pull” you’ll get the changes from the parent repository as well.\nIf you plan on contributing to a project, a fork is usually the best way to do that, if you plan on simply consuming the project (e.g. run a tutorial) then cloning is fine. A fork can always be appropriate.\nOr, if you plan on updating and making changes that you’d want to preserve, a fork allows you to do that in your own repository, whereas cloning would need you to have permissions to write (push) to the repository."

Then click the blue “CLONE” button. It will take a few moments to clone the repository into your Hub.\nYour link should look like https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/2021-Cloud-Hackathon. For example, the link is https://github.com/virdi/2021-Cloud-Hackathon. Note that it include your github username in the repo link.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the terminal (command line) as per github workflows: first-time setup.\nOnce the repository is cloned, you will see a new directory in the “File Browser” panel on the left named “2021-Cloud-Hackathon”.

    "text": "Step 5. Tracking changes (Optional)\nNow that you have forked and cloned the repository in your Hub, you can make changes (edit, add, and/or delete content) and track these files using git. In this step, we will provide an overview of how to use git using the graphical interface (the JupyterLab git extension).\n\nStep 5.1. Configure Git (git config)\nConfigure git with your name and email address as shown here.\ngit config --global user.name \"Makhan Virdi\"\ngit config --global user.email \"Makhan.Virdi@gmail.com\"\nOpen a new terminal: File &gt;&gt; New &gt;&gt; Terminal\n\nConfigure git to store your github credentials to avoid having to enter your github username and token each time you push changes to your repository(in Step 5.5, we will describe how to use github token instead of a password)\ngit config --global credential.helper store\n\n\nStep 5.2. Create a new file\nLet’s create a new file: In the left panel on your Hub, click on the “directory” icon and then double click on “2021-Cloud-Hackathon” directory. Then, create a new file using the text editor in your 2i2c JupyterHub (File &gt;&gt; New &gt;&gt; Text File). Add some text to this file, for example: A test file. Save this file and rename it to test.txt.\n\n\n\nStep 5.3. Track the changes to the new file (git add)\nClick the git icon in the left panel. You can see that the newly added file is in the “Untracked” section. You can click the + icon next to the file name to let git track this file for changes.\n\n\n\nStep 5.4. Commit the changes to the new file (git commit)\nNow, you will see that the file is Staged, which means that git is ready to take a snapshot of this file (and the repository) with the changes that you made. This snapshot is called a commit. To commit the changes, add a note (called a commit message) by typing in the text box that say “Summary”.\nNow, click the blue “COMMIT” button to commit this change.\n\nNote: A short message indicating the type of change to this file is a good practice. Optionally, a longer description may be added to the “Description” field.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5.5. Transmit committed changes to your github (git push)\nAt this stage, you have committed the changes to your git repository on your Hub. However, these changes are still on your Hub and needs to be transmitted to your repository on github (so that both the local copy on the JupyterHub and the remote copy on github are in sync).\nAs seen in the picture below, the git extension indicates (with an orange dot on the cloud icon) that it is ready to push your changes to the remote (remote = your repository on github.com). To push to github, click the cloud button with an up arrow (circled in red in the picture).\n\nWhen you push for the first time, it will ask that you input your credentials. You will need to set this up with your Personal Access Token (PAT), explained next.\n\n\nStep 5.6. Setup your Personal Access Token (PAT)\nWhen you see the following screenshot, GitHub is asking for you to input your credentials. (Note: you see this screenshot when you have committed work to push to GitHub.com, as detailed above).\n\nThe git extension in the Hub is prompting you to enter your github.com credentials. Enter you github.com username and a Personal Access Token (PAT); DO NOT use your password.\nTo create a PAT, visit https://github.com/settings/tokens/new and create a new token with the permission as per the image below and specify its validity for 90 days.\n\nIMPORTANT: You will see this token only once, so be sure to copy this. If you do not copy your token at this stage, you will need to generate a new token.\n\nOnce you generate the token, copy it and paste in the Hub window that prompted you to enter the “Personal Access Token”.\n\nGit will show a message at the bottom right telling that the changes were “Successfully pushed”. Also, you will see that the “cloud icon with an up arrow” no longer has an orange dot, indicating that there are no more committed changes to push to the remote (github.com).\n\nNote: You have configured git extension to store your credentials. You will not be prompted for your login/token again!\n\n\nThat’s all. You can use the same workflow (add &gt; commit &gt; push) for any other new or modified files!\n\n\nNote: If you are comfortable with the command line, you can use the Terminal (In Hub, New &gt; Terminal) and follow the steps outlined in the Clinic section."
