This event encourages the completion of a project where participants deploy a Hugging Face model based on their creative ideas. All kinds of projects are welcome!\nThe main emphasis is on collaboration over competition, enabling participants regardless of their technical proficiency to present a working demo and get a special badge. Through this hackathon we hope to foster a community of individuals passionate about Hugging Face, promoting mutual growth and learning.\n\n\nHow do I start?\nThe hackathon follows a straightforward process:\n\nparticipants join in teams of up to three members,\ncreate and deploy their projects on the Hub,\nand describe their project in the README.md on Spaces.\n\nRegardless of familiarity with Hugging Face, there’s a supportive environment, with tutorials and a dedicated Discord channel for communal learning and interaction. Dive in, learn, and collaborate!\nFor more information, please refer to the logistics guide and feel free to leave us a message."

    "text": "How to Form Teams in Discord\nDiscord offers an ideal platform for participants to connect, discuss ideas, and form teams for our hackathon. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you navigate the team formation process on Discord.\n\n1. Join the Official Hackathon Discord Server\nFirst and foremost, ensure you’ve joined the official hackathon Discord server.\n\n\n2. Familiarize Yourself with the Channels\nOnce you’ve joined, take a moment to familiarize yourself with the various channels. There should be a specific channel dedicated to team formation, named #team-formation.\n\n\n3. Introduce Yourself\n\nIn the #team-formation channel, post a brief introduction about yourself. Include:\n\nYour skills and expertise\nYour hackathon goals\nWhat you’re looking for in team members\n\n\nFor example:\n\n“Hi, I’m Alex! I specialize in NLP and have experience with Hugging Face. Looking for a frontend developer and a data scientist to form a team. Let’s create something amazing together!”\n\n\n\n4. Connect with Others\nEngage with other participants’ introduction posts. If someone seems like a potential fit for your team, you can:\n\nReact to their message with a thumbs-up emoji.\nSend them a direct message to discuss in more detail.\n\n\n\n5. Use Voice Channels for Deeper Discussion\nIf you’re getting serious about teaming up, hop into one of the available voice channels to chat in real-time. This will help ensure compatibility and alignment of goals.\n\n\n6. Confirm Your Team\nOnce you’ve formed a team:\n\nAnnounce your team members in the #team-formation channel: “_Team [YourTeamName]: @Alex, @Jordan, @Taylor_”\nDesignate a team leader who’ll be responsible for official communications during the hackathon.\n\n\n\n7. Create a Discord Group (Optional)\nYou can make a private channel for your team via Discord Groups. This will give you a dedicated space to discuss strategies, share resources, and collaborate.\n\n\n8. Stay Updated\nAlways keep an eye on #announcements or any other important channels. Admins or organizers will post important updates related to team formation or other hackathon processes.\n\nDiscord offers a seamless platform for participants to connect and form teams. By following the steps above, you’ll find compatible team members and set the stage for a successful hackathon experience. Best of luck, and happy team forming!"

    "text": "Step 5. Tracking changes (Optional)\nNow that you have forked and cloned the repository in your Hub, you can make changes (edit, add, and/or delete content) and track these files using git. In this step, we will provide an overview of how to use git using the graphical interface (the JupyterLab git extension).\n\nStep 5.1. Configure Git (git config)\nConfigure git with your name and email address as shown here.\ngit config --global user.name \"Makhan Virdi\"\ngit config --global user.email \"Makhan.Virdi@gmail.com\"\nOpen a new terminal: File &gt;&gt; New &gt;&gt; Terminal\n\nConfigure git to store your github credentials to avoid having to enter your github username and token each time you push changes to your repository(in Step 5.5, we will describe how to use github token instead of a password)\ngit config --global credential.helper store\n\n\nStep 5.2. Create a new file\nLet’s create a new file: In the left panel on your Hub, click on the “directory” icon and then double click on “2021-Cloud-Hackathon” directory. Then, create a new file using the text editor in your 2i2c JupyterHub (File &gt;&gt; New &gt;&gt; Text File). Add some text to this file, for example: A test file. Save this file and rename it to test.txt.\n\n\n\nStep 5.3. Track the changes to the new file (git add)\nClick the git icon in the left panel. You can see that the newly added file is in the “Untracked” section. You can click the + icon next to the file name to let git track this file for changes.\n\n\n\nStep 5.4. Commit the changes to the new file (git commit)\nNow, you will see that the file is Staged, which means that git is ready to take a snapshot of this file (and the repository) with the changes that you made. This snapshot is called a commit. To commit the changes, add a note (called a commit message) by typing in the text box that say “Summary”.\nNow, click the blue “COMMIT” button to commit this change.\n\nNote: A short message indicating the type of change to this file is a good practice. Optionally, a longer description may be added to the “Description” field.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5.5. Transmit committed changes to your github (git push)\nAt this stage, you have committed the changes to your git repository on your Hub. However, these changes are still on your Hub and needs to be transmitted to your repository on github (so that both the local copy on the JupyterHub and the remote copy on github are in sync).\nAs seen in the picture below, the git extension indicates (with an orange dot on the cloud icon) that it is ready to push your changes to the remote (remote = your repository on github.com). To push to github, click the cloud button with an up arrow (circled in red in the picture).\n\nWhen you push for the first time, it will ask that you input your credentials. You will need to set this up with your Personal Access Token (PAT), explained next.\n\n\nStep 5.6. Setup your Personal Access Token (PAT)\nWhen you see the following screenshot, GitHub is asking for you to input your credentials. (Note: you see this screenshot when you have committed work to push to GitHub.com, as detailed above).\n\nThe git extension in the Hub is prompting you to enter your github.com credentials. Enter you github.com username and a Personal Access Token (PAT); DO NOT use your password.\nTo create a PAT, visit https://github.com/settings/tokens/new and create a new token with the permission as per the image below and specify its validity for 90 days.\n\nIMPORTANT: You will see this token only once, so be sure to copy this. If you do not copy your token at this stage, you will need to generate a new token.\n\nOnce you generate the token, copy it and paste in the Hub window that prompted you to enter the “Personal Access Token”.\n\nGit will show a message at the bottom right telling that the changes were “Successfully pushed”. Also, you will see that the “cloud icon with an up arrow” no longer has an orange dot, indicating that there are no more committed changes to push to the remote (github.com).\n\nNote: You have configured git extension to store your credentials. You will not be prompted for your login/token again!\n\n\nThat’s all. You can use the same workflow (add &gt; commit &gt; push) for any other new or modified files!\n\n\nNote: If you are comfortable with the command line, you can use the Terminal (In Hub, New &gt; Terminal) and follow the steps outlined in the Clinic section."
