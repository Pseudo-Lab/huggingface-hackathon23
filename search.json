    "text": "The Everyday AI Hackathon is a collaborative open science learning experience aimed at fostering innovation and practical knowledge in AI. The goals are to:\n\nEmpower Participants: Enable every participant to harness the power of AI to solve real-world problems and make a positive impact.\nFoster Learning and Collaboration: Create a supportive environment where participants can learn from each other, share knowledge, and collaborate to bring ideas to life.\nPromote Practical Application of AI: Encourage the development and implementation of AI solutions that are applicable and beneficial in everyday scenarios.\nStrengthen Community Engagement: Build a strong, inclusive, and diverse community that continues to collaborate and grow in the field of AI, contributing to open science and open data initiatives.\n\nOutcome: Participants will prototype AI applications, developing practical AI solutions and contributing to the open community. This event is an opportunity for individuals of all levels to explore, learn, and prototype workflows, enhancing their skills and understanding of AI.\nThis is an opportunity for researchers, students, and professionals who might not yet have had the opportunity to work with Hugging Face technology to explore, learn, and prototype workflows, but more intermediate or advanced users interested in further exploring AI applications are also welcome.\n\n\n\n\nThe Everyday AI Hackathon is where participants will explore the intersection of AI, Hugging Face technology, and daily life through demonstration tutorials and hands-on “hacking” projects. To best benefit from the event, we recommend some familiarity or experience with:\n\nHugging Face technology and tools; and\nProgramming skills using Python. We plan to accept participants with diverse skill levels and backgrounds in programming. However, to best benefit from and contribute to the program, participants are expected to have some experience with Python programming.\n\nNo prior experience with Hugging Face technology is required, but we encourage both beginner and more experienced participants to apply.\n\n\n\nIn the application form, we encourage you to think about and provide an AI use case that you would like to prototype. During the hackathon, participants will get into teams of their choosing, around a common use case to “hack” - by which we mean collaboratively experiment working in with Hugging Face technology. The use cases provided in the application form will also help the organizers best prepare materials tailored to those use cases.\nApplications are now open! Please apply here\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the Everyday AI Hackathon, the selected participants will have access to Cloud environments and will be guided on how to use the environment, import needed data recipes and resources, and will have the opportunity to explore and develop AI applications using example tutorials as building blocks.\nParticipants will be able to freely ask questions about the hackathon through a dedicated discord channel as well as engage with other participants.\nThe Everyday AI Hackathon is an open science event: all tutorials and examples are developed openly and will be publicly available during and following the hackathon. Participants will strengthen their practice of open science, using open source code and “hacking” their projects openly to enable further discovery and contributions by the broader open community following the hackathon.\nThroughout the hackathon, participants will learn about Hugging Face’s impact on AI workflows for model and dataset discovery, usage, and prototyping to enable faster, more efficient time to science.\n\nIn the two weeks leading up to the hackathon, participants are encouraged to review background resources that will faciliate a more effective hackathon experience. These resources will be shared here leading up to the Hackathon dates, and will be accessible to all data users, whether they attend the hackathon or not.\nThe following datasets are currently available from the Hugging Face Hub. Participants can choose to prototype a cloud-based science workflow using a combination of these datasets, as well as data from other sources (e.g. AI Hub). If your preferred dataset is not yet available in the Hugging Face Hub, consider using a current cloud-based dataset as proxy to explore prototyping.\nExample use cases to explore (note these are for inspiration only, you are not limited to these workflows):\n\nTODO\n\nThis event is motivated by the dawn of the era of AI. Hugging Face is in the process of collecting models and datasets to its Hub, driven by a rapid rate of transformers-based innovations in the industry. More will be available in the Hugging Face Hub in the coming years. The paradigm shift from on-premise (local) to cloud-based model distribution, and that from “build from scratch” to “use and iterate” present opportunities and challenges. Guiding users through this transition is of the utmost importance.\n\n\n\n\nQ: Who can apply to participate in the hackathon?\nA: Anyone with an interest in AI and Hugging Face technology, from beginners to advanced users, is welcome to apply.\nQ: Is there any fee to attend the hackathon?\nA: No, the event is free to attend, but an application is required.\nQ: Will there be any prizes or certificates for participants?\nA: Yes, prizes will include certificates, official Hugging Face swags, and Hugging Face Hub credits.\nQ: Can I participate if I don’t have any experience with Hugging Face technology?\nA: Absolutely! The hackathon is a learning experience, and participants of all levels are encouraged to apply.\nQ: Will there be any post-event engagement or follow-up?\nA: Yes, efforts will be made to sustain engagement and collaboration within the community post-event, with platforms or forums for continued knowledge sharing and interaction.\n\n\n\n\nThe 2023 Everyday AI Hackathon is a safe learning space and all participants are required to abide by our Code of Conduct.\n\n\n\nThe Everyday AI Hackathon: A Hugging Face Community Event is hosted by PseudoLab and sponsored by Hugging Face, aiming to foster innovation and learning within the Korean AI community.\nWe thank all of the additional PseudoLab members that have have joined as helpers.\nThank you to the open science community that has created software, teaching resources, and workflows that we have been able to build heavily from!

    "text": "Project Hacktime Setup\nHere are some suggestions for collaborating with your project groups (and beyond!) using GitHub.\nThis means a combination of creating a place to collaborate (a github repository) and a shared workflow to contribute.\n\nCreate a repository on GitHub.com\nJust one person does this.\nYou can do this in one of your user/organization accounts, or ask someone from the Cloud Hackathon Team to create one for you in the NASA-Openscapes organization.\nHere are instructions for creating a repo on GitHub.com — remember to make it public so that other hackathon folks can see and help!\n\n\nDiscuss edit access vs branches\nThe person who created the repo will manage the permission.\nThe simplest way to collaborate on GitHub is if everyone has permission to edit the repository directly through the main branch. Talk to your team — folks that have experience using branches can do so but others can push changes directly to the main branch.\nHere are instructions for updating github repo permissions.\n\n\nClone repo into 2i2c\nEverybody does this.\nTo to the JupyterHub, go to your Terminal, then:\ngit clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.\n\n\nCheck in as you push changes\nWhether you’re using branches or not, check in with each other as you push updates to avoid merge conflicts and have the latest progress.\nHere are instructions for a workflow with branches (optional).\n\n\nUploading files from your local computer to 2i2c\nDo this using the “Upload Files” button in JupyterHub in 2i2c, the UP arrow two over from the big blue + button."

    "text": "GitHub Q&A\n\nWhen should I fork+clone instead of just clone?\nFrom Mike Gangl:\nA fork becomes ‘independent’ of the repository you’re forking. So you control if/when you pull in changes. a clone on the other hand, will be linked to the original repository- so if you do “pull” you’ll get the changes from the parent repository as well.\nIf you plan on contributing to a project, a fork is usually the best way to do that, if you plan on simply consuming the project (e.g. run a tutorial) then cloning is fine. A fork can always be appropriate.\nOr, if you plan on updating and making changes that you’d want to preserve, a fork allows you to do that in your own repository, whereas cloning would need you to have permissions to write (push) to the repository."

Teams evolved throughout the Hackathon, some joined as a team and welcomed others, and other teams formed and merged throughout the week.\nHackathon participants will have 3 months of continued access to the 2i2c JupyterHub and Slack as they continue experimenting. This way we can all learn more about what the transition to the Cloud looks like (and costs) and support more researchers using NASA Earthdata on the Cloud.\nBelow is brief information about each project team, with links and screenshots from slides and notebooks in GitHub repos that they shared on the final day of the Hackathon."

The purpose of these sessions is for you to gain hands-on experience in working together on a well-defined problem, in a collaborative space where you can talk things through and get help.\n\n\n\nHacking is a session of focused, highly collaborative work time – often involving coding – in which the group creates conditions for rapid absorption of new ideas and methods. The word “hack” or “hackathon” has many different interpretations, both positive and negative. Here our intention is to foster the idea of hacking as a fun, interactive and welcoming environment to explore and experiment with computer code.\n\n\n\nParticipants are invited to start conversations about projects in the Slack channel 2021-nasacloudhack-projects one week before the Cloud Hackathon begins.\n\nIf you have a project idea brewing, please pitch it in this channel (even if you have signed up for the cloud hackathon as a team; tag your proposed teammates if you already have that worked out).\nStart a thread with “Project idea:” and then provide a few sentences. Include whether you are looking for teammates to join this project. Others who are interested can respond in a thread.\nWe welcome a broad range of project topics. People often use project time to dig deeper into concepts introduced in tutorials, to explore problems within their own research, or to advance community data sharing and software building efforts.\nThe Cloud Hackathon team is here to help you get clear on project ideas and decide on what is possible within 5 days. Feel free to reach out to any of us between now and the Cloud Hackathon in the 2021-nasacloudhack-help channel, or @ us – we all have “helper” appended to the front of our names. !\n\nAt the end of Day 1 of the Cloud Hackathon we will have a Pitchfest where proposer(s) can pitch their idea, and mention whether they are still looking for teammates or if they have already formed a team using the Slack _#2021-nasacloudhack-projects _channel. At this time we will finalize the project teams for the week.\nTeam hacktime will begin on Day 2.\nEach team is encouraged to identify a project lead, likely the person who pitched the idea, who has knowledge of the datasets and the specific problem to be explored. But roles can be assigned as the group decides to best fit skills and needs.\nThroughout the hackathon we will have optional morning office hours 8-9am PT for additional support or team check-in time.\nOn the final day of the Cloud Hackathon, each team will present their work in a series of lightning talks.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have a project idea already brewing, we encourage you to share that with participants on our Slack channel 2021-nasacloudhack-projects.\nFeel free to explore various projects and initiate conversations.

Create a new file\nLet’s create a new file: In the left panel on your Hub, click on the “directory” icon and then double click on “2021-Cloud-Hackathon” directory. Then, create a new file using the text editor in your 2i2c JupyterHub (File &gt;&gt; New &gt;&gt; Text File). Add some text to this file, for example: A test file. Save this file and rename it to test.txt.\n\n\n\nStep 5.3. Track the changes to the new file (git add)\nClick the git icon in the left panel. You can see that the newly added file is in the “Untracked” section. You can click the + icon next to the file name to let git track this file for changes.\n\n\n\nStep 5.4. Commit the changes to the new file (git commit)\nNow, you will see that the file is Staged, which means that git is ready to take a snapshot of this file (and the repository) with the changes that you made. This snapshot is called a commit. To commit the changes, add a note (called a commit message) by typing in the text box that say “Summary”.\nNow, click the blue “COMMIT” button to commit this change.\n\nNote: A short message indicating the type of change to this file is a good practice. Optionally, a longer description may be added to the “Description” field.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5.5. Transmit committed changes to your github (git push)\nAt this stage, you have committed the changes to your git repository on your Hub. However, these changes are still on your Hub and needs to be transmitted to your repository on github (so that both the local copy on the JupyterHub and the remote copy on github are in sync).\nAs seen in the picture below, the git extension indicates (with an orange dot on the cloud icon) that it is ready to push your changes to the remote (remote = your repository on github.com). To push to github, click the cloud button with an up arrow (circled in red in the picture).\n\nWhen you push for the first time, it will ask that you input your credentials. You will need to set this up with your Personal Access Token (PAT), explained next.\n\n\nStep 5.6. Setup your Personal Access Token (PAT)\nWhen you see the following screenshot, GitHub is asking for you to input your credentials. (Note: you see this screenshot when you have committed work to push to GitHub.com, as detailed above).\n\nThe git extension in the Hub is prompting you to enter your github.com credentials. Enter you github.com username and a Personal Access Token (PAT); DO NOT use your password.\nTo create a PAT, visit https://github.com/settings/tokens/new and create a new token with the permission as per the image below and specify its validity for 90 days.\n\nIMPORTANT: You will see this token only once, so be sure to copy this. If you do not copy your token at this stage, you will need to generate a new token.\n\nOnce you generate the token, copy it and paste in the Hub window that prompted you to enter the “Personal Access Token”.\n\nGit will show a message at the bottom right telling that the changes were “Successfully pushed”. Also, you will see that the “cloud icon with an up arrow” no longer has an orange dot, indicating that there are no more committed changes to push to the remote (github.com).\n\nNote: You have configured git extension to store your credentials. You will not be prompted for your login/token again!\n\n\nThat’s all. You can use the same workflow (add &gt; commit &gt; push) for any other new or modified files!\n\n\nNote: If you are comfortable with the command line, you can use the Terminal (In Hub, New &gt; Terminal) and follow the steps outlined in the Clinic section."
