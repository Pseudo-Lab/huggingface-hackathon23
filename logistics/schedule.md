**The 2023 Everday AI Hackathon will take place October 20 - November 10th**.   

An optional pre-hackathon clinic will be held on October 15th from 8-10am KST, and the recording will be made available to all hackathon participants to review on their own.

Most Everyday AI Hackathon activities are **virtual**. We will engage primarily with this group and schedule via Google Meet and Discord; see [prerequisites & getting help](https://pseudo-lab.github.io/2023-EverdayAI-Hackathon/logistics/prerequisites.html).

**Google Meet links** will be posted on the `2023-everydayaihack-general` Discord channel
