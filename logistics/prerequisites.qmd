## Prerequisites

Before the Hackathon, please do the following (20 minutes). All software is free.
If you are attending the Clinic, please do this in advance of the Clinic. 

1. **GitHub username**
    - Create a GitHub account (if you donâ€™t already have one) at <https://github.com>. Follow optional [advice on choosing your username](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html)
    - Please [provide your GitHub username here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfOd0RhzEo5sFq_NgjZJa0C6cmaicTOjPS290iCbHbFTI-8zg/viewform?usp=sf_link); this will allow us to add you to the cloud hackathon workspace.
    - Remember your username and password; you will need to be logged in during the workshop!
1. **Hugging Face account** 
    - Create a Hugging Face account (if you don't already have one) at <https://hf.co/join>
    - Remember your username and password; you will need to be logged in during the workshop!
1. **Discord**
    - Join our Discord workspace (invite sent via email). In the `2023-everydayaihack-projects` channel, suggest a hackathon project idea/use case, and mention if you are looking for teammates to join. Read through other entries and comment on those of interest to you. On Day one of the hackathon we will hold a project pitchfest and finalize teams for the week. 
    - Learn more about [how we'll use Discord during the workshop](#discord)
1. **Google Meet**
    -  Be prepared to call into Google Meet using the link provided in the Discord `2023-everydayaihack-general` Channel. 
1. **Get comfortable** 
    - Consider your computer set-up in advance, including an external monitor if possible. You will be following along on your own computer while also watching an instructor live-code over Google Meet (or equivalent), and will also want quick-access to Discord to ask for help and follow links.

## Getting help

We will use Discord rather than Google Meet Chat as our main channel for help, since the conversations are preserved beyond a single call and since it's easier to reply and have threaded conversations and post screenshots.

### Discord

You will be invited to the PseudoLab Discord organization, where there is a growing community of [ML experts](https://pseudo-lab.github.io/spotlight). (New to Discord? See this [Quick Start Guide](https://zenodo.org/record/3763730#.YYkoL3mIZpQ)). We have three private Discord channels for the Hackathon: 

**2023-everydayaihack-general**: General channel is for announcements and general questions and communications.
 
**2023-everydayaihack-projects**: Projects channel  is for for participants to pitch project ideas and discuss projects with the whole hackathon group. As teams form you can have direct messages with your team (and we can create new channels as needed). 

**2023-everydayaihack-help**: Help channel is the place to get troubleshooting help: please paste error messages and post screenshots and we will help you by replying to your post.

### Google Meet Breakout Rooms

#### During Tutorials Session

If you'd like to talk to someone and live-screenshare about your issue, please write in Google Meet Chat that you need help and we will move you into a breakout room with a helper.

#### During Team Hacktime

During the team project time, you will be placed in a Google Meet breakout room with your respective teammates to collaborate more easily. If you have questions as you work, post your question(s) in the Discord `2023-everydayaihack-help` Channel and a helper will respond in that thread. If needed, a helper can also join your team's Google Meet breakour room for easy screensharing, troubleshooting or to further discuss a question.
