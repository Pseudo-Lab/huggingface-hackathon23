## For Hackathon Helpers - A Mentor’s Guide

*Mentor = trainer = helper = any Hugging Face KREW or PseudoLab volunteer*

### Discord

**Channels in PseudoLab workspace**

Update your Discord name temporarily to include “helper”, e.g. Wonhyeong Seo (Helper)

* **Mentors’/Helper channel** - **_#r-huggingface-krew_** 
    * Our back channel to coordinate amongst ourselves
* **General channel** - **_#2023-everdayaihack-general_**
    * Announcements, general questions and communications
* **Pitchfest channel -** **_#2023-everdayaihack-projects_**
    * Participants discuss project ideas
    * Use discord direct message (DM) for team/project work
* **Help channel** - **_#2023-everdayaihack-help_**
    * Troubleshooting, share screenshots, etc
    * When you see a question you will reply to, please add the “eyes” emoji below so other helpers know that you are looking into it. Then please reply in-thread in Discord to help. Can tag additional helpers if you need further support.

### Github 

Hackathon repo: **<https://github.com/Pseudo-Lab/huggingface_krew/tree/23hackathon>**; any updates to the main branch will be updated in this book (via GitHub Action).

* [tutorials](https://github.com/Pseudo-Lab/huggingface_krew/tree/23hackathon/tutorials) folder
* [tutorials-templates](https://github.com/Pseudo-Lab/huggingface_krew/tree/23hackathon/tutorials-templates) folder for live coding - same as tutorials but the code is removed and only markdown remains
* Participants will create their own repos, we can link to their projects in the cloud hackathon repo to capture the hackathon projects artifacts
* Working with the CH repo
    * Participants are instructed to fork the CH repo to their own github, then clone the CH repo. This way they can push any updates or changes to the CH repo within their own version of the repo without impacting the original CH repo
    * This should be covered in Tutorial 0. 
* What happens to my work on <cloud provider> after the 3 months?
    * Code: push to your own Github repo
    * Data and analysis outputs - working on S3 solution
* From Clinic chapter: “This section is a step-by-step guide to set up git on your [cloud instance](https://pseudo-lab.github.io/2023-EverdayAI-Hackathon/clinic/cloud) and configure git to use your [github.com](https://github.com/) account for managing your repositories hosted on [github.com](https://github.com/).” We are also looking into using Git Extension. 


### Google Meet teleconference

* **Host**: Wonhyeong and ...
* **Break-out rooms**
    * We will set up Breakout rooms ahead of time, and have helpers ready to meet with participants. If there are many people in breakout rooms/lots of same issues, we'll pause the tutorial and address things together
    * If a participant is stuck and needs 1:1 help, ping one of the Google Meet hosts in the mentor/general channel to place you in a breakout room with participant X
* **Chat** - Encourage participants to use the Discord _general_ or _help_ channel for questions, not the Google Meet chat
    * Wonhyeong will mention this in the Welcome (logistics) session beginning of Day 1

### Tutorials workflow

* Welcome mentor share link to CH Book during Welcome each day
* Welcome mentor to instruct participant to spin up cloud instance if they haven’t done so that morning already
* Tutorial presenters can also role-model having the CH Book open as a tab when they teach if they want to refer to it. 
* Tutorial presenter will be using [template](https://github.com/Pseudo-Lab/huggingface_krew/tree/23hackathon/tutorials-templates) notebooks based on each tutorial 
* Tutorial presenter will live code, and participants will follow along in their instance 
* Tutorial presenter screen Google Meet level should be 130%


### Helpers support during “live coding” Tutorials Demos



* Tutorial mentor live codes, participants follow along
* All other helpers monitor Discord _help (_and_ general)_ channel for questions, people being stuck
    * When you see a question you will reply to, please add the “eyes” emoji below so other helpers know that you are looking into it. Then please reply in-thread in Discord to help. Can tag additional helpers if you need further support.
    * If needed, ask host to place you and participant in breakout room temporarily for easier help/support
* Reminder: Update your Discord name temporarily to include “helper”, e.g. “Wonhyeong Seo (Helper)”


### Helper support during Team Hack Time

* **Google Meet host** - Place participants in breakout rooms based on their team 
    * Can collaborate in Google Meet breakout rooms and in their discord team DM (direct messaging) 
* **Participants** should post any team project questions in the _help_ discord channel; screenshot are helpful
    * Participants can create a DM thread with their teammates for team work discussions

    * and/or ask host to be added to the team Google Meet breakout room
* **Mentors** use the _mentor_ discord channel if you need additional help from a colleague
